# Deployment Concepts

Deployment in Idun is about choosing **where** the platform runs (local vs self-hosted vs managed), and **how** configuration and policies are managed (standalone Engine vs managed mode).

**Time to read:** ~5 minutes.

## Key choices

- **Standalone vs managed Engine**
- **Data residency** (on-prem / EU cloud / private VPC)
- **Observability backends** (Langfuse/Phoenix/LangSmith/GCP)
- **State persistence** (SQLite vs PostgreSQL, multi-tenant boundaries)
