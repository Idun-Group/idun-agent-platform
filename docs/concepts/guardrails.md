# Guardrails

## Overview

Guardrails provide safety mechanisms to control and constrain agent behavior during execution.

## Types of Guardrails

Guardrails can include content filtering, rate limiting, action restrictions, and safety checks.

## Configuration

Define guardrails in your agent configuration to automatically enforce constraints during runtime.

## Validation

Input and output validation ensures agents operate within defined boundaries and safety requirements.

## Monitoring

Track guardrail activations and violations to understand agent behavior patterns and refine constraints.
