# Guardrails Concepts

Guardrails make agent behavior safer and more predictable by validating inputs/outputs and enforcing policies (e.g., PII detection, content constraints, prompt-injection resistance).

**Time to read:** ~5 minutes.

## How Idun applies guardrails

- **Consistent enforcement** across supported frameworks (LangGraph, ADK, Haystack)
- **Config-driven**: policies are attached via configuration and can be managed centrally in managed mode
- **Auditable**: tie guardrail decisions to traces and logs for compliance and debugging
