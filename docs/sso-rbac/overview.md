# SSO and RBAC

The Idun Agent Platform includes robust Single Sign-On (SSO) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) features to help you securely manage user access and permissions.

## SSO Compatibility

Idun supports integration with leading SSO providers such as **Okta**, Auth0, Microsoft Azure AD, and Google Workspace. This allows you to seamlessly connect your organization's authentication system, simplifying user management and access.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

With RBAC, you can define fine-grained roles and permissions for each user. Assign specific rights to manage agents, observability settings, guardrails, MCP (Multi-Cloud Platform) servers, and memory configurations. This ensures that users only have access to the features and configurations relevant to their responsibilities.

## Secure Agent Access

By leveraging SSO and RBAC together, you can:

- Create and onboard users through your existing identity provider
- Assign or revoke role-based permissions at any time
- Control who can view, configure, or manage agents and platform integrations
- Allow or restrict access to critical observability and compliance features

These capabilities help organizations maintain security, streamline user experience, and enforce operational best practices across teams.
